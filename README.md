# lxd builds

This repository serves to build tarballs of LXD using GitLab's CI.

To download a build in GitLab:

1. go to `Pipeline` in the left menu;
2. select the latest successful build (marked _passed_);
3. select the target Linux distribution;
4. select `Browse` in the right menu;
5. select the tarball;
6. either click the link to download or copy it to your favorite tool.

I try to stay up to date with the latest version, but there might be some
delays at time.
